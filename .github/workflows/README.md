# Docker Workflow Architecture

This document describes the distributed multi-platform CI/CD workflow architecture for building Docker images in the docker-whisperX project.

## Overview

The workflow architecture has been completely refactored to implement **distributed multi-platform builds** with massive parallel processing capabilities. The original single `docker_publish.yml` workflow has been split into 5 specialized workflow files, each supporting native multi-platform builds (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) to improve maintainability, parallel processing efficiency, and fault isolation for building 370+ platform-specific Docker images (10GB each).

## Architecture Details

### Three-Stage Build Process

Each workflow implements a consistent three-stage pattern:

#### Stage 1: Distributed Build

#### Stage 2: Selective Testing
- **Strategic Selection**: Test key combinations to validate functionality without resource exhaustion
- **Platform Coverage**: Ensure both architectures work correctly
- **Quality Gates**: Functional testing before manifest creation
- **Resource Management**: Balanced testing approach for large matrices

#### Stage 3: Manifest Merge
- **Multi-platform Images**: Combine platform-specific digests into manifest lists
- **Registry Optimization**: Single image tag supports both architectures
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing image naming conventions
- **Deployment Ready**: Images ready for multi-architecture deployment

### Resource Optimization Strategies

#### Caching Hierarchy
```
cache-base-{image}          # Base image layer cache
cache-model-{model}         # Model-specific dependency cache  
cache-matrix-{model}-{lang} # Language-specific alignment cache
```

#### Testing Strategy
- **Base Images**: Test critical base functionality
- **Model Cache**: Test model loading and initialization
- **Distil English**: Comprehensive English language testing
- **Matrix Images**: Selective testing of key language combinations (large-v3-zh, tiny-en)

#### Parallel Job Management
- **Max-parallel Settings**: Prevent GitHub Actions infrastructure overload
- **Job Dependencies**: Proper sequencing without blocking parallel execution
- **Artifact Lifecycle**: Short retention periods for intermediate build artifacts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of partial failures in large matrices

## Migration Notes

### From Original Workflow
- All job functionality preserved and enhanced with multi-platform support
- Same Docker build arguments and caching strategies, now optimized for distributed builds
- Enhanced test procedures with platform-specific validation
- Same output artifacts and attestations, now with manifest list support
- **Major Enhancement**: Native ARM64 builds replace QEMU emulation

### Architecture Changes
- **Build Strategy**: From single-job sequential to distributed parallel builds
- **Platform Support**: From QEMU emulation to native multi-platform builds  
- **Scale**: From 175 images to 370 platform-specific builds + 185 manifest lists
- **Testing**: From sequential testing to selective parallel testing strategy
- **Caching**: From simple caching to sophisticated layered cache hierarchy

### Breaking Changes
- Workflow names changed (affects status badges and external references)
- Build timing significantly improved due to parallel execution
- Different workflow run IDs for different stages and platforms
- **Performance Impact**: 50-70% faster build times expected

### Rollback Strategy
- Original workflow backed up as `docker_publish.yml.backup`
- Can be restored by renaming backup file
- All new workflow files can be safely deleted for rollback
- **Note**: Rollback loses multi-platform build benefits

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Status Monitoring
- **Multi-level Tracking**: Monitor workflow → job → platform level status
- **Platform-specific Visibility**: Separate status for amd64 and arm64 builds
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitor parallel job utilization and build durations
- **Cache Performance**: Track cache hit rates and build acceleration

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time Comparison**: Monitor time reduction vs. previous architecture
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Track simultaneous job execution and bottlenecks  
- **Resource Utilization**: GitHub Actions minute usage and cost optimization
- **Error Rates**: Platform-specific failure analysis and trends

### Common Issues

#### Multi-Platform Specific
- **Platform Build Failures**: Check platform-specific runner availability (ubuntu-24.04-arm)
- **Digest Artifact Issues**: Verify artifact upload/download between build stages
- **Manifest Creation Failures**: Check digest availability and format compatibility
- **Cache Conflicts**: Verify cache key uniqueness across platforms and workflows

#### Scale-Related Issues  
- **GitHub Actions Limits**: Monitor parallel job usage against account quotas
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Watch for runner capacity issues during peak usage
- **Network Bottlenecks**: Monitor artifact transfer times for large matrices
- **Storage Limitations**: Manage artifact retention and storage usage

#### Legacy Issues
- **Image Reference Failures**: Check SHA tag generation and image availability
- **Workflow Chaining**: Verify `workflow_run` triggers are correctly configured
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure all workflows have proper GITHUB_TOKEN permissions

### Debugging Strategies

#### Platform-specific Debugging
- **Single Platform Testing**: Temporarily disable one platform to isolate issues
- **Selective Matrix Testing**: Use workflow_dispatch with reduced matrix for debugging
- **Cache Isolation**: Clear platform-specific caches to eliminate cache-related issues

#### Large-scale Debugging
- **Staged Rollouts**: Test changes on smaller matrices before full deployment
- **Parallel Limit Adjustment**: Reduce max-parallel settings during debugging
- **Selective Re-runs**: Re-execute only failed combinations rather than entire workflows

#### Tools and Techniques
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Manual triggering with custom parameters for testing
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging for multi-platform build processes
- **Artifact Inspection**: Download and analyze build artifacts for troubleshooting
- **Performance Profiling**: Use GitHub Actions built-in timing and resource metrics
